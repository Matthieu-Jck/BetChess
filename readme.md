# Predictive Chess

## Introduction
Welcome to Predictive Chess, where the classic game of chess meets strategic prediction. In this unique twist on traditional chess, players not only make their moves but also bet on their opponent's next move. Successfully predicting an opponent's move grants the player an advantageous double move on their next turn!

## How to Play
### Rules
- Each turn consists of two phases:
  1. **Move**: Make your standard chess move.
  2. **Predict**: Predict your opponent's next move.
- If you predict correctly, you earn the right to make two consecutive moves on your next turn.
